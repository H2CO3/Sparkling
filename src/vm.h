/* A structure representing a frame of the call stack.
 * An array of this structure is returned by 'spn_vm_stacktrace()'.
 *
 * The 'function' member is the function object that corresponds
 * to the stack frame.
 *
 * Meanwhile, 'return_address' is an offset into the bytecode of
 * the _caller_ of 'function'. This address is where control flow
 * would have been transferred, had the function returned.
 * Hence, with the help of the debug information, 'return_address'
 * can be used to infer the instruction/location from where 'function'
 * has been called (the last machine word of that SPN_INS_CALL
 * instruction is located at address 'return_address - 1').
 *
 * A negative 'return_address' indicates that the caller
 * was a native (C) function and not a Sparkling function/script.
 *
 * 'exc_address' is an approximation of the address where
 * the actual runtime error has occurred:
 *
 *  - for frame #0, this is the same as the return value of
 *    'spn_vm_exception_addr()'.
 *  - for frames #1 and higher, it is computed by subtracting one
 *    from the return adddress of the previous (calling) frame.
 *    Actually, this will be the address of the last parameter
 *    passed to the function (or the call instruction itself if
 *    there were no parameters), since the return address always
 *    immediately follows the call instruction. So the debug info
 *    will correctly map it to the source location of the call.
 *
 * (if the caller is a native function, then the return address
 * of the frame will be negative, and so will be the return
 * address minus one, so this computation doesn't mess up the
 * indication of whether the callee returns to C or Sparkling.)
 *
 * 'sp' is an opaque pointer that stores the stack pointer of
 * the frame. It is used by 'spn_vm_get_register()'.

/* Remarks:
 * --------
 *
 * (I): the CALL instruction must know and fill in the number of arguments and
 * the return address in the next (to-be-pushed) stack frame. Arguments:
 * a: return value; b: function to call; c: number of call-time arguments
 * (the following 'c' octets are register indices which point to the
 * call arguments of the function)
 *
 * (II): the caller stores the return value from the called frame
 * to its own operation stack, then pops (frees) the called frame.
 *
 * (III): operators that have a result/destination register (that's pretty
 * much everything except, return and jumps) should release its value before
 * overwriting its contents in order to avoid memory leaks. Also, since the
 * destination register can potentially be the same as one of the sources,
 * instructions with a destination AND source registers need to compute the
 * result beforehand, store it in a temporary variable, and only after all
 * calculations are done, should the destination register be updated.
 *
 * (IV): constants include 'nil', boolean literals, integer and floating-point
 * literals. integer and floating-point literals take up one or more additional
 * machine word, so they need special treatment (namely, the instruction
 * pointer is to be increased appropriately when loading such constants)
 *
 * (V): this loads a symbol in the local symbol table. Local symtab entries
 * can be string literals, unresolved references to globals and references
 * to functions (either global or lambda) defined in the current file.
 *
 * (VI): the data following the instruction is the header of the function
 * followed by the actual bytecode. The instruction itself has no parameters.
 *
 * Here's some visualisation for 'function foobar(x, y) { return x + y; }'.
 * The vertical bars are boundaries of 'spn_uword's.
 *
 *                    | <-- header -> |
 * +-----------------------------------------------------------+
 * | SPN_INS_FUNCTION | 2 | 2 | 3 | 0 | ADD 2, 0, 1 | RETURN 2 |
 * +-----------------------------------------------------------+
 *                      ^   ^   ^   ^   ^
 *                      |   |   |   |   +--- actual entry point
 *                      |   |   |   +--- number of symbols in local symtab (*)
 *                      |   |   +--- total register count (variables & temp)
 *                      |   +--- number of declaration arguments (**)
 *                      +--- body length, without function header
 *
 * (*)  The number of local symbols is always 0 unless the function
 *      represents the top-level translation unit.
 * (**) The number of declaration arguments ("formal parameters") is
 *      always 0 in the top-level function.
 *
 * (VII): SPN_INS_CLOSURE takes two parameters, the index of the register
 * in which a free function resides (operand A), and the number of upvalues
 * (operand B). After the opcode follow as many 'spn_uword's as there are
 * upvalues (B). Each spn_uword describes an upvalue (a local variable in an
 * enclosing  function, captured by the closure) using the following format:
 *
 * +-------------------------------+------------------------------+
 * | Upvalue type (OPCODE, 8 bits) | Upvalue index (OPA), 8 bits) |
 * +-------------------------------+------------------------------+
 *
 * The upvalue type is one of the members of the 'spn_upval_type' enum:
 *
 * - SPN_UPVAL_LOCAL represents an upvalue which is a local variable of the
 * immediately enclosing function.
 * - SPN_UPVAL_OUTER, on the other hand, refers to a variable which itself is
 * in the closure of the enclosing function (i. e. it's not an own local
 * variable thereof, but rather a variable of a function two or more levels
 * up the lexical scope).
 *
 * The instruction reads the unbound function value from the specified
 * register, creates a closure function object from it, sets its upvalues,
 * then replaces the contents of the register (the original function object)
 * with the newly created closure.
 *
 * (VIII): SPN_INS_METHOD looks up a method by name 'c' in the class
 * descriptor of object 'b'. The object may be an array (most commonly),
 * a string, or even a (usually strong) user info value.
 *
 * (IX): SPN_INS_PROPGET calls the property getter method of object 'b',
 * passing in the index/name 'c'.
 *
 * (X): SPN_INS_PROPSET calls the property setter method of object 'a',
 * passing in the index/name 'b' and its new value 'c'.
