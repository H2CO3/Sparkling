 * does not need to allocate a new string each time it is called,
 * because it is superfluous and wasteful, and can lead to serious
 * degradation of performance due to the memory fragmentation it
 * may potentially cause.
 *
 * This function takes a pointer to a C string, and returns a string
 * object initialized with it, without allocating it dynamically.
 * The reference count of the returned object is set to the special
 * value UINT_MAX to indicate that it should not be released or retained.
 *
 * In other words, HERE BE DRAGONS. This function should ONLY EVER
 * BE USED by 'spn_hashmap_get_strkey()'. DO NOT USE IT yourself!
